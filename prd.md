The Experiment: A "Disaster Recovery Drill"

Instead of a purely technical test, frame the experiment as a business continuity drill:

Setup: Run two parallel systems (one Flink, one Spark) processing a mock stream of customer orders.

Simulate Failure: Intentionally shut down a server in each system.

Measure Business KPIs:

Time to Restore Service: How many seconds/minutes until the system was fully operational again?

Risk of Lost Revenue: How many "orders" were delayed or potentially dropped during the outage? (Both systems aim for zero loss, but the pause in processing is key).

Data Integrity: Was every single order accounted for after recovery? (This demonstrates the value of "exactly-once" guarantees for financial and auditing purposes).

This data provides a clear, defensible rationale for choosing the technology that best aligns with your company's risk tolerance and financial model.
